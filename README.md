🧠 Design Philosophy

This project blends modern UI trends with old-school calculator familiarity.
The dual-theme engine reflects a "best of both worlds" mindset:

Glassy: futuristic, soft, translucent

Simple: traditional, sharp, grounded


A calculator that respects the past while embracing tomorrow. 🚀
